# FDMTMod
An AOSP-fundamentalist project. We tries to create AOSP ROM factory image for all Android Phone.

Our goal was stop the Phone manufacturer from distribute their fucking "Custom style UI" or release an alternative AOSP ROM for user, like Emotion UI, MIUI, Coollife UI, Flyme OS, iOS-like UI. What the fuck is this! They force you to use their custom Android system after you bought their phone, and they even try all ways to prevent you from changing their "Easy and pretty UI".

Absolutely this repository was not a standard code project, you cannot download the source like a simple "git clone" from http://android.googlesource.com/ and a simple "lunch" and "make" to generate the factory image. But we will push all code (Drivers, BGP, frameworks) we edited here.

Will edit this file later.
